##FEATURES:

* data is saved to server / database 
* totals for the income and expense are added and displayed on top
* balance of expense - income is shown on very top
* all transactions are added to a table for viewing
* all expenses are added to a chart for viewing
* user can delete transactions by selecting delete checkbox
