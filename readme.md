#BUDGET APP
By: Kelsey Stiff
<br>

##FEATURES:
* user can select the + button to add a transaction
* user enters in transaction data and selects if it is an income or expense
* data is saved to server / database 
* totals for the income and expense are added and displayed on top
* balance of expense - income is shown on very top
* all transactions are added to a table for viewing
* all expenses are added to a chart for viewing
* user can delete transactions by selecting delete checkbox

##KNOWN BUGS:

###*App doesnt start working until an Income transaction AND an Expense transaction have been added and page is refreshed

###* Deleting a transaction also does not work because of same issue - a income and expense transaction must both exist for page to live update

* No validation on if income/expense radio button is selected
